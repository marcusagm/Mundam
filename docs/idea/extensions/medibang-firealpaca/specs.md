The MDP (.mdp) file format is the native, proprietary format for MediBang Paint and FireAlpaca. It is designed to preserve layers, text, selection data, and specific project features like panel materials. It offers lossless storage, meaning image quality does not deteriorate upon saving. 
Supported Features: Saves complex layer structures, blend modes, transparency, and special manga/panel tools.
Compatibility: Exclusively supported by MediBang Paint and FireAlpaca. It cannot be directly uploaded to social media sites.
Export Options: While native to MediBang, users can export to PNG, JPG, PSD, BMP, and TIFF.
Workflow: Ideal for "working" files, allowing for future edits to individual layers.
Cloud Saving: Supports cloud saving with a MediBang account. 
MDP files are essential for retaining editability when working across different MediBang applications.
